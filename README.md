# AshLang
The re-write of my programming language

This language is intended to be a hobby language at first, I will probably think about expanding it to be production-code quality in the future, once the fundamentals like bytcode generation and interpretation are implemented!

For a list of things I need to do, [the ToDo list](see docs/todo.txt)

# Syntax
The current syntax is as follows

## Class declaration
[m] class [n] [a] [s] { ... }

Where [m] is a list of modifiers, [n] is an identifier, [a] is a list of arguments enclosed by parentheses and [s] is a list of super types prefixed with a colon.

Etc
