# AshLang [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SamTebbs33/AshLang.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SamTebbs33/AshLang)

The re-write of my programming language

This language is intended to be a hobby language at first, I will probably think about expanding it to be production-code quality in the future, once the fundamentals like bytcode generation and interpretation are implemented!

For a list of things I need to do, see [the todo list](docs/todo.md)
