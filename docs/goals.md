# Language goals

* Simple and familiar syntax
* Garbage collection
* Simple variable and function definitions
* Type inference
* Compiled to JVM bytecode
* Usable with C/C++ code via a native interface. This could be extended to other compiled languages, such as Rust.
* Optionals, operator overloading
